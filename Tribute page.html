        <h2>Here's a time line of Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke's life:</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="tribute-info">
        <ul >
            <li> <strong>1940</strong>
                - Born in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1964</strong>
                - After graduating from the Bible College of Wales and returning to Germany, Bonnke led a series of
                meetings in Rendsburg. He began receiving speaking invitations from all around Germany and the rest of
                the world. Bonnke met Anni Suelze at a gospel music festival, and admired the grace with which she
                recovered from a wrongly pitched music performance at the expense of losing the competition. He offered
                to preach at the church she attended one Sunday and fell in love with her. They married in 1964 and had
                three children.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1967</strong>
                - Bonnke studied at the Bible College of Wales in Swansea, Wales, where he was inspired by the director,
                Samuel Rees Howells. In one meeting after Howells spoke of answered prayer, Bonnke prayed, "Lord, I also
                want to be a man of faith. I want to see your way of providing for needs." Passing through London, he
                had a chance meeting with the famous preacher George Jeffreys, who encouraged the young German student.
                After graduation, he pastored in Germany for seven years. His African ministry, which he was principally
                known for, began in 1967 in Lesotho. He subsequently held evangelical meetings across the continent.
            </li>

            <li> <strong>1974</strong>
                - Bonnke founded the mission organisation Christ For All Nations (abbreviated CfaN). Originally
                based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the headquarters were relocated to Frankfurt, Germany, in 1986.
                This was done primarily to distance the organisation from South Africa's apartheid policy at the time.
                Today CfaN has 9 offices across 5 continents.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1984</strong>
                - Bonnke began his ministry holding tent meetings that accommodated large crowds. According to an
                account published by the Christian Broadcasting Network, in 1984 he commissioned the construction of
                what was claimed to be the world's largest mobile structure – a tent capable of seating 34,000; this was
                destroyed in a wind storm just before a major meeting and therefore the team decided to hold the event
                in the open air instead. According to this account, the event was subsequently attended by over 100,000
                people which is far greater than the 34,000 seating capacity the tents could contain.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1991</strong>
                - during Bonnke's visit to Kano in Nigeria, there were riots in the city as Muslims protested over
                remarks he had reportedly made about Islam in the city of Kaduna on his way to Kano. A rumor was spread
                that Bonnke was planning to "lead an invasion" into Kano. Muslim youths gathered at the Kofar Mata
                Eide-ground where they were addressed by several clerics who claimed that Bonnke was going to blaspheme
                Islam. About 8,000 youths gathered at the Emir's palace and after noon prayers the riots ensued, during
                which many Christians sustained various injuries and several churches were burned. After nine years, he
                returned to Nigeria to preach.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>2000</strong>
                - Bonnke announced his "farewell gospel crusade" to be held in Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2017. Lagos
                is also the location of a gospel crusade held in 2000 which, according to CfaN, is the organisation's
                largest to-date, drawing an attendance of six million people. In 2019 Reinhard Bonnke was set to
                headline the G12 Africa Conference in Pretoria, South Africa.
            </li> 

            <li> <strong>2019</strong>
                - Bonnke died on 7 December 2019, surrounded by his family according to a statement signed by his wife.
                Bonnke had announced on his official Facebook page in November 2019 that he had undergone femur surgery
                and needed time to "learn how to walk again".
            </li >

        </ul>
        <p  class="comment">Over the 79 years of his life, it is estimated that over 79 million people - a million for each year of his life
        - came to Christ as a result of Bonnke's ministry. He has been called a "giant and a general in the Army of
        God". Reinhard Bonnke died 7 December 2019 at age 79.</p>
